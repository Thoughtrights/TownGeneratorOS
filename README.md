# Medieval Fantasy City Generator
This is the source code of the [Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator/) (also available [here](http://fantasycities.watabou.ru/?size=15&seed=682063530)). It 
lacks some of the latest features, namely waterbodies, options UI and some smaller ones. Maybe I'll update it later. 

You'll need [OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/openfl) and [msignal](https://github.com/massiveinteractive/msignal) 
to run this code, both available through `haxelib`.
